Hello!  
My name is Winnie Phebus.  
I am a Computer Science major concentrating in Software at Northeastern University, graduating May 2023. 
  
I am interested in Mobile App Development, and currently have Android Kotlin, Android Java, Flutter, Jetpack Compose, Kotlin Multiplatform, SwiftUI, and Swift experience.  
I am particularly interested in multiplatform and cross-platform development for Mobile applications.
